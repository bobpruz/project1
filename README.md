# Concept
The concept behind this project was to create an affirmation application that helps the user get their day started off on the right foot. How often do we check out phones the first thing in the morning? Many of us would answer that it is the first thing we do. Get Your Day Started Right is an application that you can look at when you first wake. The user will be greeted with an inspirational quote and nice imagery when they first reach the page. At the bottom of the page the user will find a spotify playlist that will help them get ready to take on the day.


## The Developers:
* Michael Cota
* Martin Cruz
* Mitchell Frey
* Robert Prusinowski
* Yasmine Saad
* William Strothe


### Challenges:
* Several original ideas could not be implemented due to API cost or API call restrictions
* Spotify API tokens
* Spotify API random playlist


### Successes:
* Random quotes with no author (i.e. null) credited as "Anonymous"
* Gifs are only pulled from the Giphy API with the tag of "scenery"
* Spotify player embedded and shows random playlist with refresh of page or refresh by button
